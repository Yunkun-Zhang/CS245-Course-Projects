% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
High-dimensional features has been a hard issue for data scientists in a long period of time. In this work, we evaluated and compared several dimensionality reduction methods, including feature selection, feature projection and feature learning. In order to measure the performance of these methods, we apply it to a 2048-dimension data, and use a SVM classifier to evaluate its performance.

For feature selection methods, we apply forward feature selection, which is rather straightforward, and genetic algorithm, which is harder in comparison. For feature projection methods, we experimented kernel form of principal component analysis (Kernel PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) , auto-encoder (AE) and its variational form (VAE). For feature learning, we analyzed t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS).

The report is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:2}, we introduce the methods we applied in detail; Section~\ref{sec:3} presents our results obtained and analysis of the result. Finally in Section~\ref{sec:4} we conclude this work.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:2}
\subsection{Feature Selection}
Feature selection is a rather intuitive way to do dimensionality reduction, given its clarity and simplicity. Basic feature selection methods include \textbf{forward and backward feature selecton}, where we either iteratively select or eliminate one feature from the features set until certain criterion is met. A typical advanced feature selection method is \textbf{Genetic Algorithm}, where we simulate the natural process of evolution to find the optimal subset of features. In this lab work, we experimented with forward feature selection on variance, as well as genetic algorithm to find out the relation between our strategy and its performance.
~\\
\subsubsection{Forward Feature Selection on Variance}
Forward feature selection iteratively select features from the current feature set on some rule until reaches some criterion. In this lab work we choose ``maximum variance'' as the rule, and set the number of features selected as the termination criterion, namely ``top-k variance''. The method is straightforward and simple, with the advantage of requiring less compilation resources and reduced running time.

\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithm}
Genetic algorithm is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, where the natural rule of evolution is applied to find the optimal individual in the whole population. After initialization of the whole population of chromosomes, the algorithm performs four steps -- fitness evaluation, selection, crossover and mutation -- iteratively, until the termination criterion is met. We define the chromosomes as a 0-1 mask of all features, where 1 indicates the feature is selected, and 0 indicates not. Following we would describe our implementation of all four steps in this lab work.

For the \textbf{fitness evaluation} part, we design our fitness function as follow:
$$
\mathrm{fitness}(x) = w_s\times S_s + w_f\times S_f
$$
where $S_s, S_f$ are score of the SVM part and features' dimensions part respectively, with $S_s$ defined as the SVM score of the currently selected features, and $S_f$ defined as $\frac{1}{\sum_i x_i}$, which encourages $x$ to have fewer $1$'s, thus selecting fewer dimensions as a result. $w_s$ and $w_f$ is the corresponding weight of these two scores, and could be adjusted to vary each part's contribution to the fitness value.

For \textbf{selection}, we first obtain a probability distribution according to the feature scores, and then sample chromosomes base on that distribution. In detail, we take $p = \frac{\mathrm{fitness}(x_n)}{\sum_n \mathrm{fitness}(x_n)}$, then keep sampling from the current chromosomes base on that until it reaches the previous number of chromosomes. We do this regardless of the possibility that some chromosomes might be sampled more than once, i.e. we allow the new population to consist of identical chromosomes.

\textbf{Crossover} means the process of two chromosomes getting mixed together to produce the next generation, i.e. its offspring. For each chromosome in the current population, we randomly select one other chromosome as its mate, and crossover on a randomly selected cross point. That is, the part in front of this cross point is the same as the former chromosome, and the part behind would belong to the latter one.

Then during \textbf{mutation}, each offspring formed has a certain possibility to mutate, i.e. to have one of its dimension change from $0$ to $1$, or from $1$ to $0$. Note that both mutation and crossover do not happen for granted, but only happen by a certain rate, in order to avoid purely-bad changes that would make the result worse.

An overall process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}. As a feature selection method, it's way more complex than forward/backward feature selection, and could gain better performance as expected. We would show its performance in later sections.

\subsection{Feature Projection}
Feature projection transforms the data to a lower-dimensional space. The transformation can be linear, including methods like \textbf{Principle Component Analysis} and \textbf{Linear Discriminant Analysis}, or nonlinear, including \textbf{Autoencoder}, etc. In this lab work, we experimented with kernel PCA, LDA, and Autoencoder to analyze the performance.
~\\
\subsubsection{Kernel Principle Component Analysis}
PCA is an unsupervised learning technique, without knowledge of data classes or labels. The main idea of PCA is to find the optimal direction(s) $\mathbf v$ to maximize the variance of $\mathbf x_i$ projected on $\mathbf v$, so that the principle direction(s) of the data is found. To be more specific, first decentralize the data, i.e., let $\bar {\mathbf x}_i = 0$. Then the variance can be written as
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf v^\top \mathbf x_i)^2 = \frac{1}{n}\mathbf v^\top \mathbf X \mathbf X^\top \mathbf v
$$
So the objective is
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\max_{\mathbf v} & \mathbf v^\top \mathbf X \mathbf X^\top \mathbf v \\
\mathrm{s.t.} & \mathbf v^\top \mathbf v = 1
\end{array}
$$
Use Lagrangian multiplier to solve the problem:
$$\mathcal L(\mathbf v) = \mathbf v^\top \mathbf X \mathbf X^\top \mathbf v + \lambda(1 - \mathbf v^\top \mathbf v)$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal L(\mathbf v)}{\partial \mathbf v} = \mathbf X\mathbf X^\top \mathbf v - \lambda \mathbf v = 0$$
$$\mathbf X\mathbf X^\top \mathbf v = \lambda \mathbf v
$$
$\mathbf v$ is the principle eigenvector of $\mathbf X\mathbf X^\top$, so it can be computed by eigen decomposition.

In kernel form of PCA, $\mathbf X$ is substitued with a projection $\phi(\mathbf X)$. Let $\mathbf v = \phi(\mathbf X)\alpha$, and define \emph{kernel matrix} $\mathbf K = \phi(\mathbf X)^\top \phi(\mathbf X)$:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf X\mathbf X^\top \mathbf v &= \lambda \mathbf v \\
\phi(\mathbf X)\phi(\mathbf X)^\top \phi(\mathbf X) \alpha &= \lambda \phi(\mathbf X) \alpha \\
\phi(\mathbf X)^\top\phi(\mathbf X)\phi(\mathbf X)^\top \phi(\mathbf X) \alpha &= \lambda \phi(\mathbf X)^\top\phi(\mathbf X) \alpha \\
\mathbf K \mathbf K \alpha &= \lambda \mathbf K\alpha \\
\mathbf K \alpha &= \lambda \alpha
\end{align*}
Similarly, $\alpha$ is the principle eigenvector of $\mathbf K$.

To perform dimensionality reduction, we choose the $k$ largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors $\boldsymbol \alpha$, and get the lower-dimensional data by $\mathbf X' = \mathbf K \boldsymbol \alpha$.

In practice, $\phi$ is usually not clear, and we only need to design the kernel $\mathbf K$. We implemented linear, Gaussian, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels, which are commonly used., based on PyTorch.

\subsubsection{Linear Discriminant Analysis}
LDA is a dimensionality reduction technique based on supervised learning.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:3}
\subsection{Dataset}
The data set we use is \emph{Animals with Attributes (AwA2) dataset} from https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/. This dataset consists of 37322
images of 50 animal classes with pre-extracted deep learning features for each image. These features has a dimension of 2048.
\subsection{Support Vector Classifier}
In all following experiments, we use support vector classifier (SVC) to classify processed data. The implementation is sklearn.svm.SVC. For the pre-extracted deep-learning features, we use linear kernel and experimented with different hyperparameter $C$'s using k-fold validation, and the result is shown in Table~\ref{tab:1}. We observe that setting $C$ as .. results in the best performance, and we use it as the baseline for following sections. In the following experiments, we sometimes tune $C$ or the kernel to search for optimal results.

\end{table}
\subsection{Feature Selection}
\subsubsection{Forward Feature Selection}
In this part, we experment with different $k$'s in top-$k$ variance feature selection, while at the same time using $5$-fold validation to find the optimal hyperparameter $C$ in SVM. We experimented with $k=100, 200, \ldots, 1000$, and tested with $C = 0.1, 1, 10$ respectively, over two different SVM kernels(\emph{linear} and \emph{rbf}), and record the average score of $5$-fold validation. The results is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2}. Overall, The score goes high as $k$ increases. However, we also notice that \emph{rbf} kernel performs astonishingly bad for all cases, that even in the best scenario it only gains a 0.6 score with 100 dimensions selected, and drops as $k$ increases. This is probably due to the fact that \emph{rbf} uses the similarity between samples to find support vectors, but as we select those features with most variance, it couldn't perform as well since the similarity would be scarce. Besides that, we observe a reasonable and promising trend of score gains with the increase of dimensions when using \emph{linear} kernel, among which $C=10$ performs the best, while the trend is most observable at $C=0.1$. The highest score we get for this part is $0.9302$ with $C=10$ and $k=1000$, but with larger $k$'s the score would continue to go up, although becoming meaningless when it comes to dimensionality reduction.

  \caption{Performance of top-k variance}
  \label{fig:2}
  \vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithm}
We implement the genetic algorithm with several hyperparameter to be tuned (see Table~\ref{tab:2} for details). Due to the limitation of computation resources, we fix the weight of two scores in our fitness function ($w_s$ and $w_f$) to be $0.9$ and $0.1$ respectively, as well as the mutation rate to be $0.5$, and tune the initialization rate (i.e., how many features are selected at first), initialization population, and crossover rate. We also tried different $C$'s when calculating the SVM score $S_s$. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:3}. We observe a trend that bigger $IR$ results in higher score, and among different settings, $C=0.1$ seems to perform better than $C=5$. This might due to the fact that once feature dimensions get decreased, data points would become more likely to locate beyond the margin, thus requiring a smaller $C$. We also draw the figure of the highest score in each iteration in Figure~\ref{fig:3}.

100&0.01&0.5&0.1&100&0.6957 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
We also draw the figure of the highest score in each iteration in Figure~\ref{fig:3}. The score doesn't always go up during the process, and for those with large $IR$, The result could be quite good in the beginning, and won't be enhanced much during iterations. Such behavior is reasonable since selecting a larger number of features at the beginning would outperform those with less features. For those who start with lower $IR$'s, there is a clear increase in its score during this process, and could go up higher if the iterations continues. Due to limitation over computation resources, we stop at the number 100, and report a best score of 0.9224 using $pop=10$, $IR = 0.3$, $CR=0.5$ and $C=1$.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:4}
The conclusion goes here.

% conference papers do not normally have an appendix
% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%

\appendices
\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
\section{}
Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment
\section*{Acknowledgment}


The authors would like to thank...
